# time_timy - A timer to display time durations
"time_timy" is a timer for elementary school students (or anybody else who cannot read numbers yet) to help estimating a time duration or remaining times (for example, to cope a task). For this purpose, a period of time can be set using the rotary encoder, which then runs down. The running time is displayed both as a number and as a (decreasing) "loading bar" using the LED strip. As soon as the time has expired, this is indicated by a red flashing.
